# Pokemon Team Builder Landing Page

The site I wanted to mimic was a food delivery service site that lets you choose which food items you want on the site. So, to create my own version of that I created a real life Pokemon Team Builder landing page which allows you choose which pokemon you want to put together form a team. If you are not familiar with Pokemon, basically it is a strategy video game where you collect creatures(pokemon) and use them to battle against other people's pokemon. There are a bunch of sites on the internet dedicated to creating theoretical Pokemon teams because a lot of people like to play competitively against other people. To put my own spin on a pokemon team builder site since there are plenty of them out there, I decided to swap out all the cartoony Pokemon for their real life equivalent. Pokemon are typically designed after some real life animal/object/etc., so I decided to find real life images that resembled them the greatest. This admitedly took forever even though I limited myself to just the starter pokemon (starter pokemon are the first pokemon you get in each game) and 8 random ones. I had to hand-pick a total of 32 images. I tried to make sure each real life image resembled the Pokemon it would represent as much as possible. I ended up with an assortment of cool and cute animals that I think even if you did not care for Pokemon you would still find enjoyable. I hope you enjoy! :D

Also there is some lingo in Pokemon so I might use vocabulary like "EV" that would only make sense if you played the game so I apologize if you get confused by any of that. There should not be too much of it though. 

Here is the link to the site I mimicked:

## What Worked Well

A lot of stuff worked well. For starters, the layout of the original site had a lot of images so I was able to fit a lot of Pokemon images into my landing page. Compared to the other site mine seems to match it pretty well in terms of layout, background color, link responsiveness, navigation menus etc. 

I was able to create a tabbed area section like they have in the original site using the radio version of the checkbox hack method. I call it a Pokemon Starter chooser. You can click different pokemon regions (regions are basically countries in the Pokemon universe, each game is based in a region) and see that region's starters. You can also hover over a starter pokemon image and see that pokemon's stats (stats are measurements of how good a pokemon is in battle) and its type. It was particularly hard to get the image of the pokemon to pop out with a text overlay mixed in with the tabbed sections, so I am happy it came together in the end. 

I was also able to implement the "Browse" drop down menu from the site using the checkbox hack method. Since I did the tabbed section first, this ended up being not that bad to implement. It ended up looking not half bad either. It allowed me to list the different pokemon types (types are kind of the Pokemon equivalent to words like reptile or mammal) which I enjoyed creating the icons for each type. 

## What Didn't

A few things did not quite work. For instance, the tabs in the Pokemon Starter chooser are perfectly centered in the full screen window and mobile view window, but if you resize the screen to somewhere in-between it gets off-centered which sucks. Also, if you resize the window right before going into mobile view the text in some places begin to overlap with each other. In the mobile view footer links, I could not think of a way to create two columns of texts using flexboxes and the elements I had, so it is all just one column of text. It looks okay but not quite the way I wanted it. Speaking of flexboxes, I tried my best to use only flexboxes but on more than a few occasions I had to resort to relative and absolute positioning. This is particularly evident in the Pokemon Starter chooser and probably why the tabs do not center properly. The method uses the float property and I think that it requires you to use it. I tried to think of a way to do it with flexboxes but could not. 

## Extra Credit

For extra credit, I implemented the "Browse/hamburger" drop down menu which is the checkbox hack you were describing. Instead of popping up a big overlay, it creates a simple drop down menu when pressed. I implemented a tabbed areas section(Pokemon Starter Chooser) which is based off of the tabbed area method described in the checkbox website you linked to us. It uses radio inputs instead of a checkbox input to create different tabs you can select between. It switches between tabs that include pictures that you can hover over and they pop out displaying text. I got the idea for this from a w3schools tutorial on hoverable images (I linked the w3school tutorial in my code). It was different from the tutorial in the way that I had to figure out how to get the overlay to display and the image to pop up at the same time when the mouse was over an image. Getting the text overlay, hover, and tabbed area to work together was a little bit of a challenge to say the very least.
